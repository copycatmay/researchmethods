      <h2>Response 1: Louise Sandhaus</h2>
      <p>
        One thing, rather, one thought that stuck out to me during the lecture
        was the selective method of preservation that the Peoples Graphic Design
        Archive (PGDA) uses. I completely understand the choice regarding the
        exclusion of contemporary design, since everything is so web-based, and
        most likely accessible, contrary to those examples of design that may be
        lost to time if not digitized and archived.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe Louise mentioned something along the lines of
        <em
          >"considering the currency of design and the digital nature of most
          designs today, they usually won't get lost to time because they are
          not preserved but rather because of other factors."</em
        >
        I generally agree with this sentiment; however this raises the question
        of what efforts are we making to preserve the digital, contrary to the
        analog?
      </p>

      <h3>its on the cloud innit</h3>
      <p>
        A plethora of our data currently lives on the cloud (or on several
        harddrives if you have good data backing practices (not me) ). Despite
        this, there seemingly is not a lot of concern on everything just
        disappearing overnight. A case study of this was with the Google cloud
        screwup in which resulted in an accidental deletion of a private cloud
        account of "UniSuper," an Australian pension fund, and the subsequent
        loss of around $135 Billion in records. (Thankfully they recovered
        because they had a backup.)
      </p>

      <p>
        With these points in mind I find myself asking, whether the ultimate
        form of preservation exists in the analog, somewhere organized neatly,
        and stored in a bunker, or in the digital, existing on a thread of
        redundancy between a multitude of servers, or better yet, a well
        mediated combination of both.
      </p>

      <h3>no contemporary?</h3>
      <p>
        During the lecture I was a little ticked off, in a sense, that the PGDA
        was targeting only works older than 20-30 years? (Not sure at the
        specific amount.) Anyhow, the rather restrictive selection process that
        I found in their moderation policy was something I disagreed with,
        albeit I still believed that their cause, the preservation of older
        design material was a noble one, I thought to myself that they should
        open up the doors to a more lenient moderation policy to allow for more
        avenues of work.
      </p>

      <p>
        This opinion was mostly driven by a thought that even contemporary media
        should also be preserved, that despite most work being digitized and
        existing on the cloud, there may work that exist only on an old 2009
        Dell laptop, that also deserve to be preserved, and remembered, but is
        instead barred by the moderation policy of the PGDA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I do understand their choices regarding this due to the
        economic implications of their operation, as well, I am not the judge of
        their organization's Ethos, I'm sure there are other databases out there
        dedicated to the preservation of more contemporary media.
      </p>

      <h3>so what?</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the lecture also prompts me to just essentially, preserve more
        of my work. I grew up during a mostly digital era, and from a young age
        was already working mostly digitally. I believe I wrote my essays on
        google docs starting in Grade 6, and by Grade 7 the school was already
        urging everyone to get their own devices. (If memory serves me right.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, I have lost countless hours of work. Disappeared among the
        ethereal nature of the web, gone when I factory reset my laptop for the
        4th time since I downloaded another virus, or simply just lost. The most
        robust archive of my work begun with the start of OCADu, once I received
        a generous 5 TB ( 1-2 TB now, a bit stingy but I wasn't gonna use all 5
        TB anyways (i'm still a little sad about it) ) on my OneDrive, and ever
        since I've been mostly working off of the cloud, and backing up my data
        physically every now and then.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've even lost about 50% of my University portfolio submissions as I was
        working off of my google account that my high school provided. Once I
        graduated, it was deleted, along with all of the data on there. I guess
        the lesson is that ultimately,
        <strong>preservation is in your own hands</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>thus.</h3>
      <p>
        Thus, I've begun reconstructing my portfolio as more of an archive of
        all of my work as well. Despite this, I am still at the mercy of how
        much I can be asked to back up my data and the cloud provider I am
        allotted. You can see the current progress of the "archive" of myself

      <h2>Response 2: J. Dakota Brown</h2>

      <p>
        First off, <em>loved</em> his talk, really gave a lot of insight into
        how closely related the history of design is to the history of "<strong
          >labor, class and gender</strong
        >" as he put it in his own words. As well, especially how applicable it
        is today, and the situation many designers may face soon with the
        meteoric rise of artificial intelligence and the looming threat of the
        automation of many of our work in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>
        But also to that, I have mixed feelings and generally, this talk brewed
        up a lot of thoughts and internal discourse for me to think on, here are
        some that were sprouted.
      </p>

      <h3>competition drives innovation</h3>
      <p>
        While not inherently exclusive to the practice of design, I find this an
        interesting topic. From my notes and what I've synthesized during the
        lecture, there seem to be a lot of examples of
        <strong>competition driving innovation</strong>. While there is an
        argument that human nature seeks to innovate, what is it that drives
        that spark for technological advancement? Is it the hope for a better
        quality of life that provides the resolve for innovators? Or is it much
        more profit minded and a capitalist nature? Or both? Something for me to
        ruminate on.
      </p>

      <h3>a deadly loss in experience</h3>
      <p>
        Brown spoke out on how Tschichold preached how "<em
          >for the worker, machine production has meant heavy, almost deadly
          loss in experience.</em
        >" How the shift towards automation was sapping interest and creativity
        out of the work itself. I agree with this sentiment completely, as of
        course there was a period of struggle for the workers when they had to
        retrain for other lines of work. Imagine practicing something that you
        are <strong>passionate</strong> about, <strong>good</strong> at, only
        for technological innovation to take, completely away from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this is why I have mixed feelings on the topic of automation. I
        believe that technological progress is <em>essential</em> for humankind,
        and I vouch for innovation on the technological front. Quality of life
        across the globe is statistically at a time high. Life expectancy has
        been steadily increasing across the globe, economic growth will lead to
        higher standards of living for developing and developed countries,
        access to education has also grown. Albeit, there are also problems with
        today's world, such as increasing inequality, especially in wealth,
        environment concerns, world conflicts and more. I am still
        <strong>bullish</strong> on the advancement of tech, especially
        artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, A.I alignment, as well as how major AI frontrunners such as
        OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, tackle the democratization of AI use will
        factor in significantly to how it will shape our world (which is kinda
        fucked that to an extent the future of the world is just dependant on
        these guys, but I digress.) I am still relatively optimistic about how
        AI will turn out, especially with the push for the
        <em>open sourced nature</em>
        of recent models in Llama, and Grok, as well as generally the ethos of
        Anthropic has reflected a thoughtful approach toward safety. However,
        Open AI going for-profit was not a good indicator, but then again how
        can you economically keep up with the hardware demands of AI without
        bringing in the revenue to support such enormous costs?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok, I might have gotten a bit off track, but overall it shows that I'm
        relatively optimistic about AI, but why? People will lose their jobs, we
        may see unemployment rise as high as <strong>30%-40%</strong>, as well
        as an even larger wealth gap if it's not handled properly. What I'm
        hyped about is how AI can provide way more agency to me as a creative,
        not necessarily a designer if everything goes right. Imagine a 
        multidisciplinary approach in which I can utilize theory germane to the 
        practice of GD and apply it to another medium, let's say, animation. I 
        have so many cool ideas as to how to potentially incorporate typography 
        into animation, as well, there are so many grandeur ideas and concepts 
        floating around in mind that can only come to fruition in two possible 
        channels:
      </p>

      <ol style="font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 1.5em">
        <li>I have a shitload of money, like a <em>shitload</em> of money.</li>
        <li>
          AI is developed to the point of <strong>agentic ability</strong>,
          which allows me to then essentially formulate my own little "team" of
          agents to ultimately pursue my own creative vision that would not have
          been available otherwise. Films, stories, animations, we are then
          essentially our own creative directors for visions of our own.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I admit, there will certainly be a "<strong>dark age</strong>" in which
        we as a society will have to adapt to this shift in labor demands. I am
        not an economist, nor am I an AI researcher so I have no solid points to
        have discourse on how we can navigate through this dark age, long it
        will be, or even what it will look like. However, optimistically
        speaking, if we were to overcome that dark age, I can only smile at the
        opportunities in which I can creatively express myself in ways
        unimaginable now. Which admittedly, is also wishful thinking, and I do
        sincerely believe that the discourse and discussions we are having today
        surrounding the near future of labor are paramount and take precedent
        over what I am discussing here today. However, I just wanted to get some
        thoughts out onto paper (or code.)
      </p>

      <h3>the generalist vs. the specialist</h3>
      <p>
        I feel like with each era of tech, our work gets less and less granular
        and more and more generalized. As an easy example, the linotype killed
        off the specialistic work of the typesetter. What was once a role that
        required <em>meticulous craft</em> is now streamlined to machines that
        manage entire lines of text at once. It's almost like each advancement
        abstracts a layer of detail, and we're killing specialized skills for
        more automated functions. Now in our current era, tasks that were once
        handled by literal teams have become abstracted to a click in indesign.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which gives rise to the question, would it be better as of right now to
        <strong>broaden our scope</strong> as designers in anticipation of the
        near future of AI? Not this is not to say you can't pursue your
        interests, do whatever you want on that front, but on the subject of our
        "prowess" as designers, we might actually find it beneficial to expand
        our skillset and essentially, opt for a more interdisciplinary approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        But its also fucked since then we're completely separated from the work
        we are actually creating. Ok sure, like imagine a situation were we can
        leverage the expertise of the AI to tackle more granular issues
        regarding UX, motion graphics, coding, or marketing even, and us as
        designers will essentially act as <em>creative directors</em> who
        influence the direction of the work being created, but in that sense,
        are we even making, or are we just directing?
      </p>

      <p>
        Process is <strong>very important</strong> to graphic design, material
        exploration, iteration, tactile experimentation are all influences in
        the design process. So does that mean there is less meaning in our work
        the less process there is?
      </p>

      <p>Will society even care? Will our clients care?</p>

      <p>Process is important to <em>us</em> and not <em>them</em>.</p>

      <p>
        But, on the other hand, becoming a generalist and leveraging tech will
        for sure empower us to tackle multifaceted briefs and problems that
        might require more interdisciplinary skillsets. Like imagine designing a
        wayfinding system by yourself in <strong>weeks</strong> with the power
