      <h2>Response 1: Louise Sandhaus</h2>
      <p>
        One thing, rather, one thought that stuck out to me during the lecture
        was the selective method of preservation that the Peoples Graphic Design
        Archive (PGDA) uses. I completely understand the choice regarding the
        exclusion of contemporary design, since everything is so web-based, and
        most likely accessible, contrary to those examples of design that may be
        lost to time if not digitized and archived.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe Louise mentioned something along the lines of
        <em
          >"considering the currency of design and the digital nature of most
          designs today, they usually won't get lost to time because they are
          not preserved but rather because of other factors."</em
        >
        I generally agree with this sentiment; however this raises the question
        of what efforts are we making to preserve the digital, contrary to the
        analog?
      </p>

      <h3>its on the cloud innit</h3>
      <p>
        A plethora of our data currently lives on the cloud (or on several
        harddrives if you have good data backing practices (not me) ). Despite
        this, there seemingly is not a lot of concern on everything just
        disappearing overnight. A case study of this was with the Google cloud
        screwup in which resulted in an accidental deletion of a private cloud
        account of "UniSuper," an Australian pension fund, and the subsequent
        loss of around $135 Billion in records. (Thankfully they recovered
        because they had a backup.)
      </p>

      <p>
        With these points in mind I find myself asking, whether the ultimate
        form of preservation exists in the analog, somewhere organized neatly,
        and stored in a bunker, or in the digital, existing on a thread of
        redundancy between a multitude of servers, or better yet, a well
        mediated combination of both.
      </p>

      <h3>no contemporary?</h3>
      <p>
        During the lecture I was a little ticked off, in a sense, that the PGDA
        was targeting only works older than 20-30 years? (Not sure at the
        specific amount.) Anyhow, the rather restrictive selection process that
        I found in their moderation policy was something I disagreed with,
        albeit I still believed that their cause, the preservation of older
        design material was a noble one, I thought to myself that they should
        open up the doors to a more lenient moderation policy to allow for more
        avenues of work.
      </p>

      <p>
        This opinion was mostly driven by a thought that even contemporary media
        should also be preserved, that despite most work being digitized and
        existing on the cloud, there may work that exist only on an old 2009
        Dell laptop, that also deserve to be preserved, and remembered, but is
        instead barred by the moderation policy of the PGDA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I do understand their choices regarding this due to the
        economic implications of their operation, as well, I am not the judge of
        their organization's Ethos, I'm sure there are other databases out there
        dedicated to the preservation of more contemporary media.
      </p>

      <h3>so what?</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the lecture also prompts me to just essentially, preserve more
        of my work. I grew up during a mostly digital era, and from a young age
        was already working mostly digitally. I believe I wrote my essays on
        google docs starting in Grade 6, and by Grade 7 the school was already
        urging everyone to get their own devices. (If memory serves me right.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, I have lost countless hours of work. Disappeared among the
        ethereal nature of the web, gone when I factory reset my laptop for the
        4th time since I downloaded another virus, or simply just lost. The most
        robust archive of my work begun with the start of OCADu, once I received
        a generous 5 TB ( 1-2 TB now, a bit stingy but I wasn't gonna use all 5
        TB anyways (i'm still a little sad about it) ) on my OneDrive, and ever
        since I've been mostly working off of the cloud, and backing up my data
        physically every now and then.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've even lost about 50% of my University portfolio submissions as I was
        working off of my google account that my high school provided. Once I
        graduated, it was deleted, along with all of the data on there. I guess
        the lesson is that ultimately,
        <strong>preservation is in your own hands</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>thus.</h3>
      <p>
        Thus, I've begun reconstructing my portfolio as more of an archive of
        all of my work as well. Despite this, I am still at the mercy of how
        much I can be asked to back up my data and the cloud provider I am
        allotted. You can see the current progress of the "archive" of myself
